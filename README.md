# Atreis keyboard

Unsplitting the Iris keyboard.

![A picture of the Atreis](pictures/GPI0El4.jpg?raw=true "The Atreis keyboard")

Based on [Keebio's Iris keyboard design files](https://github.com/keebio/iris-case),
modified to achieve the same layout in a single-piece form-factor.

## Why ?

Because the Iris is perfect, but a splitted keyboard is not the most convenient
keyboard to take when on the go.

And because we can.

## Why this name ?

Because it looks a lot like the [Atreus](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus) keyboard, but with the Iris layout.

## How do I build one ?

Two solutions:
- like I did when I started the project, laser-cut the plates and hand-wire it.
- use the PCB and case files available in this repository, wonderfully created by https://github.com/climent

# Firmware

This keyboard runs under the wonderful [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) firmware, my current (preliminary and pretty basic, but functional) code is here : https://github.com/dekonnection/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/atreis

I will eventually do a merge request in upstream QMK.
